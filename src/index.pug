      h2 Overview
      p I'm a professional JavaScript developer with 8+ years of experience. I have superb skills in technologies related to JavaScript like Angular, React, NodeJS, jQuery, etc...
      p I was a part of 50+ projects as either a front end or a back end developer and had a lot of experience in creating single-page web applications and REST APIs for various web products. I am always searching for the best practices and cutting edge technologies to be a more productive and skilled developer and get my code quality as high as I can. I'm also a big fan of the UX/UI design industry, so I can help to create usable and visually-appealing interfaces. In addition, I can do performance reviews, and web app optimizations to make sure that the user will get the best experience and your app, the best conversion.
      p My portfolio speaks for itself. If you are looking for a web developer with design skills then I am the man.

          h3 WEB Development as a hobby
          p In this period, I developed a few projects for local companies. This included public catalogues and landing pages with the ability to sort, filter and structure information. The products were built with a combination of Joomla / WordPress and configurations for a few plugins. Also, I used existing jQuery libraries to solve some UI requirements. No coding challenges, just using third-party products to get everything done.

The company offers online shops, B2B portals, reservation systems and other related solutions. When I started working for the company, in my responsibilities involved developing landing pages and websites using HTML and CSS. After several months, in addition to my other responsibilities, I started carrying out developers' interviews and creating business offers for our clients. Besides that, I was responsible for choosing technologies, estimations, plannings, and more. My team had around 3 - 5 junior front end developers, and we completed 10+ projects for a local market.

We worked in a small team, including 3 - 4 developers, a designer and project manager. This was a big leap for me as a professional WEB developer. I gained a sound understanding of how client / server interactions work, why the code structure is important, how to create code that is easy to support and how to support someone else's code. In addition, I gained experience working in a SCRUM environment.
