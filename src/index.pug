      h2 Overview
      p With over ten years of experience as a WEB developer, I possess expertise in various JavaScript-related technologies such as React, Vue, Angular, NodeJS, jQuery, and more. Throughout my career, I have been involved in over 20 projects as a full-stack expert and have gained extensive experience creating single-page applications and REST APIs for various web-based software.
      p As a passionate UX/UI design industry follower, I am well-equipped to assist in drafting visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces that exceed clients' expectations. I have faced complex design challenges throughout my career, including creating responsive layouts, optimizing performance, and ensuring cross-browser compatibility. Furthermore, I understand the importance of balancing functionality with aesthetics and user experience and the significance of developing advanced animations in achieving a cutting-edge look and feel for any product. 
      p I deeply understand the processes behind software development, from design to implementation through testing, and have developed strategies to build communication with technical and non-technical team members effectively.
      p Of course, experience alone is not enough. As the industry evolves, front-end developers must stay current with emerging technologies and tools. So whether it's learning a new framework or keeping up with evolving best practices, I prioritize staying informed and adaptable in a fast-changing landscape. By drawing on past successes and learning from past mistakes, we can build more robust, more efficient, and more effective web applications that meet the needs of our clients and delight their users. I've seen many projects suffer from bloated code, which can slow development and create maintenance headaches. One of the critical advantages of experience is the ability to anticipate and avoid common pitfalls.

          p In this period, I developed a few projects for local companies. This included public catalogues and landing pages with the ability to sort, filter and structure information. The products were built with a combination of Joomla / WordPress and configurations for a few plugins. Also, I used existing jQuery libraries to solve some UI requirements. No coding challenges, just using third-party products to get everything done.

The company offers online shops, B2B portals, reservation systems and other related solutions. When I started working for the company, in my responsibilities involved developing landing pages and websites using HTML and CSS. After several months, in addition to my other responsibilities, I started carrying out developers' interviews and creating business offers for our clients. Besides that, I was responsible for choosing technologies, estimations, plannings, and more. My team had around 3 - 5 junior front end developers, and we completed 10+ projects for a local market.

We worked in a small team, including 3 - 4 developers, a designer and project manager. This was a big leap for me as a professional WEB developer. I gained a sound understanding of how client / server interactions work, why the code structure is important, how to create code that is easy to support and how to support someone else's code. In addition, I gained experience working in a SCRUM environment.

          p As a part of the PST (Player Support Tool) team, I helped to fix numerous issues across the APP. PST is software that improves customer support efficiency by providing specialized tools that implement optimal agent workflows.
          p Then I worked with the SSP (Self-service Support Portal) team and contributed to a dark theme implementation corresponding to the rest of the Epic product's UI. A big part of the redesign was improving website accessibility by following the latest W3C standards. The other feature I was involved in was request classification, which helps minimize the number of tickets by directing relevant inquiries toward the FAQ or self-service sections. Also, as a result of my work, is significant test coverage improvement.
          p In addition, I made a few new applications for the Zendesk Help center. Zendesk provides a solution for managing customer support requests, allowing agents to do fast, personalized, and valuable customer support anywhere, anytime. To do that efficiently, I spent considerable time learning Zendesk's official documentation and open-source projects based on the same technology and picked best practices for my implementations. As a result, I have a new experience with third-party integrations.
          p Overall my primary responsibility was developing and maintaining React components of web applications. I worked closely with designers, back-end developers, the QA team, and BA to ensure that all application aspects functioned seamlessly and met the client's requirements. The code review is a way to write clean, efficient, and reusable code.
          p The last point I want to highlight is mentoring and training developers, guiding best practices and helping maintain coding standards across the team. My experience in the UX/UI design industry was a valuable asset in creating a usable and visually appealing interface.

The team comprised a project manager, a quality assurance specialist, and four front-end developers. My primary responsibility was to support the front-end application, which uses Preact. The team was highly skilled and motivated, and I found the work environment very professional. Unfortunately, booking functionality is not a priority for development due to the pandemic.
